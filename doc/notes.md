# Notes

> Development log.

## 2017-01-07

Attempted to fix GitLab CI to use `pwsh` because the image is Linux based.

## 2018-01-02 continued

Using WSL (Ubuntu) to test portability of the PowerShell script.
Use `lsb_release -a` to find WSL Ubuntu version and use
[PowerShell Linux installation instructions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/linux.md)
to find matching instructions.

Script runs fucking flawlessly, yeah!

## 2018-01-02

Implemented tests by the way of generating Word, Excel, PowerPoint files and running the script on them, then checking
the resulting extracted files for exepcted strings.

## 2018-01-01

Implemented skipping processing unchanged Office files (using `git diff` to tell if a file has changes).

Attempted recognizing block elements to surround them with blank lines in TXT file to make them stand out, abandon,
too complex to tell what should be block span and do not want the script to understand the XML structure beyond
simple picking out text nodes.

Implemented generating headers about the file being autogenerated and should not be edited.

## 2017-12-31

Implemented a draft solution for tracking XML changes in modern Office files format.
`git log` from today will reveal all the struggle because I used `git commit` to test the pre-commit hook for posterity.
