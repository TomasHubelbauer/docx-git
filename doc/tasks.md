# Tasks

> Planned development:

## Add tests

## Verify PowerShell script runs okay on non-Windows PowerShell

I suspect there will be a problem with relying on the XML functionality which is likely to be missing when not on Windows (is .NET).

## Generate README.md in generated folders and XML/TXT comment in generated files

- All subdirectories `README.md` with more information link to the repository
- All XML files XML comment atop the DOCTYPE as a first thing
- All TXT files `#` comment as a first thing
