# Tasks

> Planned development:

## Add MIT license file

## Verify PowerShell script runs okay on non-Windows PowerShell

I suspect there will be a problem with relying on the XML functionality which is likely to be missing when not on Windows (is .NET).

## Add more tests of varying complexity for all of Word, Excel and PowerPoint
